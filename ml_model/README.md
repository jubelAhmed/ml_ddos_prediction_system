# DDoS Detection Using Incremental Learning Algorithms

This repository contains a machine learning framework for real-time DDoS attack detection using incremental learning models. The project is implemented in Python and uses Jupyter Notebooks. It includes two main notebooks:

1. **DDoS_dataset_cleanup.ipynb**: A preprocessing notebook for cleaning and preparing the dataset.
2. **DDOS_detection_using_Incremental_Learning_Algorithm.ipynb**: The main notebook implementing the detection models.

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Setup the Environment**
This project is designed to run on Google Colab for easy execution and compatibility. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

- Open the desired notebook file (`DDoS_dataset_cleanup.ipynb` or `DDOS_detection_using_Incremental_Learning_Algorithm.ipynb`) in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- Upload the dataset file required for processing. Here datasets are uploaded to the Google Drive.
- Make sure the path is set correctly in the notebook.
